Welcome to Bomberman! We (Jacob Chung and Christian Stoltzfus) are pleased to present our final Computer Science project as a (working) multiplayer game. 

It's pretty basic, but here are the instructions:

Player 1 (top left, blue):
Up arrow - Move up
Down arrow - Move down
Left arrow - Move left
Right arrow - Move right
Spacebar - Place bomb (places in front of you)

Player 2 (bottom right, red):
W - Move up
S - Move down
A - Move left
D - Move right
Q - Place bomb (again, in front of you)


Either player may press U at any time to reset the game (no trolling).
